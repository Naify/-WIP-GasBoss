RPG Project: Boss Encounter

This project showcases a boss encounter where the player can choose between engaging in combat or resolving the conflict through dialogue.

The combat system is built using Gameplay Ability System (GAS) and Behavior Trees.
The dialogue system is implemented with State Trees, allowing for branching conversations and conditional outcomes.
Input bindings are inspired by the Lyra project, following modern Unreal Engine practices.

Still WIP
